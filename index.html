                <p>Long-tail keywords are the hidden gems of SEO. These specific search phrases are less competitive and often capture users who are further along in the buying cycle. For example, instead of targeting "running shoes," a long-tail keyword like "best running shoes for flat feet" can attract a more targeted audience with higher intent to purchase. By focusing on these keywords, businesses can improve their search rankings, drive relevant traffic, and boost conversion rates.</p>
